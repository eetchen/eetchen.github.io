Dr. Tao Chen, the PI of the laboratory,received his Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore in 2012. At the beginning of 2018 , he was selected into the National High Level Oversea Talent Plan , and then he joined Fudan University as a tenure-track Professor . Before joining Fudan , he worked at the top research institu- tions such as the Singapore Science and Technology Bureau, the Singapore Intelligent Robot Laboratory , and the Singapore Institute for Infocomm Research . He also has undertaken and participated in a series of projects from the Singapore government and enterprises. In addition, Dr. T. Chen has worked on the research and development of AI chipsets at the AI lab of Huawei Asia Pacific Research Institute from 2017 to 2019 , and have a number of AI products . To date, Dr. Tao Chen has published more than 40 academic papers in CCF Class A or JCR District One publications such as IEEE T-PAMI/T-IP/T-CYB/ACM’MM, and has granted a US patent.
